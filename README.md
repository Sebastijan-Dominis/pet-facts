# üê± Pet Facts ‚Äî React + TypeScript Practice App

A small React app that fetches random cat and dog facts from public APIs.

Built to practice:
- React functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useRef`)
- TypeScript type safety and narrowing
- Axios for HTTP requests with cancellation (AbortController)
- Handling async state: loading, error, success
- Conditional rendering based on fetch states

## Features

- Fetch random cat or dog facts from two different APIs
- Cancel ongoing requests when a new fetch is triggered
- Display loading, error, and fact states clearly
- Typed data with TypeScript for safer code

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
